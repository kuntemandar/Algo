## How to Use

Each file contains a self-contained implementation that can be run with Node.js:

```bash
node quicksort.js
node tree.js
node DPPractice
```

## Features

- **Educational Focus**: Clear, readable implementations for learning
- **Variety**: Covers fundamental algorithms across multiple domains
- **Standalone Files**: Each algorithm is self-contained for easy testing
- **Console Output**: Most implementations include example usage with console output

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed
3. Run any algorithm file directly: `node <filename>.js`
4. Modify the test cases in each file to experiment with different inputs

## Contributing

Feel free to add new algorithms or improve existing implementations. Each file should:
- Be self-contained
- Include example usage
- Have clear variable names and logic flow
- Include console output for verification

## Algorithm Categories

### Time Complexities
- **Sorting**: O(n log n) average case for quicksort and mergesort
- **Tree Operations**: O(log n) for balanced BST operations
- **Dynamic Programming**: Varies by problem, typically O(nÂ²) or better
- **Graph Traversal**: O(V + E) for DFS

This collection serves as a practical reference for common algorithms and data structures implemented in JavaScript.
